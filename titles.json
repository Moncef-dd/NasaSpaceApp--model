'explanation': "Captured in colorful telescopic portraits, two cosmic owls glare back toward planet Earth in this intriguing comparison of planetary nebulae. On the left is M97 in the constellation Ursa Major, also known in the northern hemisphere as the Owl Nebula. On the right is its visual counterpart, the southern Owl Nebula in the constellation Hydra, cataloged as PLN 283+25.1. Both nebulae are remarkably symmetric, round, and similar in size, some 2 light-years across or about 2,000 times the diameter of Neptune's orbit. Planetary nebulae are produced during a final phase in the life of a sun-like star, an example of the fate that awaits the Sun when it runs out of nuclear fuel in another 5 billion years. Both images were made using narrowband filters and different color mappings. The image of the southern Owl also includes broadband data, bringing out the surrounding star field.", 'hdurl': 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1005/OwlNS_goldman.jpg', 'media_type': 'image', 'service_version': 'v1', 'title': 'Northern and Southern Owls', 'url': 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1005/OwlNS_goldman_c900.jpg'}, {'copyright': 'Babak Tafreshi', 'date': '2007-10-26', 'explanation': "Comet 17P/Holmes stunned comet watchers across planet Earth earlier this week. On October 24, it increased in brightness over half a million times in a matter of hours. The outburst transformed it from an obscure and faint comet quietly orbiting the Sun with a period of about 7 years to a naked-eye comet rivaling the brighter stars in the constellation Perseus. Recorded on that date, this view from Tehran, Iran highlights the comet's (enhanced and circled) dramatic new visibility in urban skies. The inset (left) is a telescopic image from a backyard in Buffalo, New York showing the comet's greatly expanded coma, but apparent lack of a tail. Holmes' outburst could be due to a sudden exposure of fresh cometary ice or even the breakup of the comet nucleus. The comet may well remain bright in the coming days.", 'hdurl': 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0710/Holmes-Tehran3_inset.jpg', 'media_type': 'image', 'service_version': 'v1', 'title': 'Comet Holmes in Outburst', 'url': 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0710/Holmes-Tehran3_inset.jpg'}, {'date': '2018-01-26', 'explanation': "On sol 1943 of its journey of exploration across the surface of Mars, the Curiosity Rover recorded this selfie at the south rim of Vera Rubin Ridge.

Rainier, Washington USA, planet Earth, was produced by the Spaceborne Radar Laboratory which flew on the Space Shuttle Endeavour in 1994. Radar, short for RAdio Detection And Ranging, is a technique which coordinates the operation of a radio transmitter and receiver to measure the direction, strength, and timing of radio echos from the surface of distant objects. An actual image of an object can be constructed by recording and analyzing many echos. One advantage of using radar imaging in planetary studies is that images can be made regardless of cloud cover or lighting conditions. During the early 90s, NASA's Magellan spacecraft was able to use radar imaging to produce similar high resolution maps of the surface of Venus.

Spacecraft NEAR Shoemaker in orbit around asteroid 433 Eros found out earlier this month when it recorded its first fly-over sequence.  The saddle region of the Sun-orbiting space-mountain appears to zip past the camera in this condensed hour-long time-lapse sequence.  The spacecraft was orbiting about 200 kilometers above the asteroid.  Movies such as this are scientifically useful for discerning between regions that are naturally dark and regions that have their brightness dominated by shadows.

Although the large ash plume was not unparalleled in its abundance, its location was particularly noticeable because it drifted across such well-populated areas. The Eyjafjallaj�kull volcano in southern Iceland began erupting on 2010 March 20, with a second eruption starting under the center of a small glacier on 2010 April 14. Neither eruption was unusually powerful.  The second eruption, however, melted a large amount of glacial ice which then cooled and fragmented lava into gritty glass particles that were carried up with the rising volcanic plume.

Recent analyses of measurements taken by the Huygen's probe that landed on Titan in 2005 January indicate that the atmosphere is actually saturated with methane at a height of about 8 kilometers.  Combined with observations of a damp surface and lakes near the poles, some astrobiologists conclude that at least a methane drizzle is common on parts of Titan.  Other astrobiologists reported computer models of the clouded moon that indicate that violent methane storms might even occur, complete with flash floods carving channels in the landscape.  The later scenario is depicted in the above drawing of Titan.   Lightning, as also depicted above, might well exist on Titan but has not been proven.  The findings increase speculation that a wet Titanian surface might be hospitable to unusual forms of life.", 'hdurl': 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0608/titanrain_garlick_big.jpg', 'media_type': 'image', 'service_version': 'v1', 'title': 'Methane Rain Possible on Titan', 'url': 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0608/titanrain_garlick.jpg'}, {'copyright': 'Doug Murray', 'date': '2000-11-20', 'explanation': "The Leonid Meteor Shower this year could be described as good but not great.

Mercury's old surface is heavily cratered like many moons.  Mercury is larger than most moons but smaller than  Jupiter's moon Ganymede and Saturn's moon Titan.  Mercury is much denser and more massive than any moon, though, because it is made mostly of iron. In fact, the Earth is the only planet more dense.  A visitor to Mercury's surface would see some strange sights.  Because Mercury rotates exactly three times every two orbits around the  Sun, and because Mercury's orbit is so elliptical, a visitor to Mercury might see the Sun rise, stop in the sky, go back toward the rising horizon, stop again, and then set quickly over the other horizon.  From Earth, Mercury's proximity to the Sun causes it to be visible only for a short time just after sunset or just before sunrise.", 'hdurl': 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0002/merc4_m10_big.gif', 'media_type': 'image', 'service_version': 'v1', 'title': 'Southwest Mercury', 'url': 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0302/merc4_m10.jpg'}]
